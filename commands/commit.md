# Commit & Sync Checklist

## Overview
This is a general checklist for your GitHub commit and syncs you'll do. Your commit must have a intuitive description for the commit message. 

## Steps
1. **Preparation**
    - Make sure all changes are correct and tested
    - Check the branch you're on before commiting
    - Pushes to `main` must be confirmed with the user

2. **Commit message**
    - Review all changes at the worktree
    - Summarize the changes in a clear and objective text
    - Always include context and the motivation for those changes
    - If those changes were related to a specific task, mention the task, plan and project

3. **Sync remote** 
    - Always make sure you've synchronized origin/remote
