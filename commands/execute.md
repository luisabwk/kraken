# Execution checklist

## Overview 
This is a guide for our plan and task execution. 

## Checklist 
1. [ ] Review the plan .md file, inside the `/plans` folder;
2. [ ] Read the tasks listed by the `5. Tasks` section
    2.1 [ ] If there we've already started the plan and there are tasks with "Done" or "In progress" statuses, always check what we have at the `Notes` section of the task .md file at `/tasks` folder. 
    2.2 [ ] If there is no task started, make sure that we have the project folder created at `/projects` and then we can move on to the tasks. 
3. [ ] Always check your code for lints, unit and type tests. 
4. [ ] If we need any API for the project, create a .env file at the `/projects/[projectName]` folder and refer to it whenever needed.
